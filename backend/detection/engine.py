"""Detection engine (``backend/detection/engine.py``).

Runs every rule on each newly stored event, turns matches into alerts and
de-duplicates them. The rules themselves are pure functions; this module is the
only detection code that touches the database.

Typical use, in the ingestion route, after the event(s) are stored::

    events = await run_in_threadpool(storage.insert_events, db, batch)
    results = await run_in_threadpool(engine.process_events, db, events, settings)
    for r in results:                       # r.created tells new alert from updated alert
        await manager.broadcast({"kind": "alert", "data": r.alert.model_dump(mode="json")})

(``process_event`` is synchronous and quick; call it from a worker thread, as above, or from a
plain ``def`` endpoint, never straight from ``async def`` code.)

What happens for one event
--------------------------
1. Skip entirely when its source IP is in ``detection_ignore_ips``.
2. For each enabled rule (``detection_disabled_rules`` switches rules off by name):
   a. ask the rule which earlier events it needs (``history_query``) and load them with
      ``storage.events_in_window``;
   b. call ``rule.evaluate(event, recent_events, settings)``;
   c. if it returns an alert, store it with ``storage.upsert_alert``: the same rule +
      source IP inside ``alert_cooldown_seconds`` updates one alert (count and evidence
      grow, severity can only escalate) instead of creating many. With a cooldown of 0
      every match creates its own alert.
3. A rule that raises is logged and skipped; the other rules and ingestion carry on.

Windows are anchored on the EVENT's timestamp, not the wall clock, so late or replayed
events are judged against the traffic around them. The cooldown uses the wall clock.

Settings used here (all optional)
---------------------------------
``alert_cooldown_seconds``   de-duplication window, 0 turns it off      (default 300)
``detection_ignore_ips``     comma-separated IPs / CIDR ranges to skip  (default none)
``detection_disabled_rules`` comma-separated rule names to switch off   (default none)

To add a rule: create the module in this package with ``RULE_NAME`` and ``evaluate`` (and
``history_query`` if it needs earlier events), import it below and add it to ``RULES``.
